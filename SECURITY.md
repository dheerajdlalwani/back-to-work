I am relatively very new to web-extension development & I am not a security expert, nor am I an expert at developing web-based extensions. So, if you do find any vulnerabilities, high risk or low risk, please please do send them my way. I shall try my best to patch them as soon as possible. User safety, security & privacy is my utmost priority.
